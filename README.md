# morse_smale
Python tools for Morse Smale Complex analysis and visualization.

It looks at the critical points of a manifold and partitions the manifold based
on these extrema.

# Usage

The common usage will be to create partitions for given sample points and scalar
sample values.

```
import morse_smale

# k_neighbors is the main parameter that may need to be tweaked
result = morse_smale.nn_merged_partition(sample_points, sample_values,
                                         k_neighbors=15)
```

See `examples/` for more.
